# Computer-vision---Object-detection-and-tracking
Object detection and tracking in computer vision identifies objects in images or video and follows their movement across frames. Detection finds and labels items with bounding boxes, while tracking assigns IDs and monitors motion over time. It is used in surveillance, traffic systems, robotics, and autonomous vehicles.
